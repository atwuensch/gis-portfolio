# gis-portfolio
This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS class at CMU.

# About Me
My name is Alison Wuensch. I am a graduate student at Heinz College, getting my Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM). After I graduate in May, I intend to work with local governments in Allegheny County. Currently, I work for the Borough of Churchill in Allegheny County as a Community Development Specialist.


# What I Hope to Learn
I really enjoyed learning about GIS last semester and am looking forward to learning more about it this semester and applying my knowledge. The Borough of Churchill just launched their GIS portal on their website, and I am looking for ways in which I can be helpful in maintaining the GIS portal. I am interested in learning about how I can be an asset to the team, and a local government team in general, who might have limited resources and knowledge about GIS but still find ways in which GIS can be useful to the team. For that reason, I am also looking forward to learning more about GIS software other than Esri.
