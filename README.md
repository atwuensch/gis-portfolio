This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS class at CMU.

# About Me



# What I Hope to Learn
I work for a local government in Allegheny County that just launched their GIS portal on their website. I am interested in learning about how I can be an asset to a local government team in general who might have limited resources and knowledge about GIS but still find ways in which GIS can be useful to the team. For that reason, I am also looking forward to learning more about GIS software other than Esri.
