# gis-portfolio
This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS class at CMU.

# About Me
My name is Alison Wuensch. I am a graduate student at Heinz College, getting my Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM). After I graduate in May, I intend to work with local governments in Allegheny County. Currently, I work for the Borough of Churchill in Allegheny County as a Community Development Specialist.


# What I Hope to Learn
The Borough of Churchill just launched their GIS portal on their website. I am interested in learning about how I can be an asset to their team, and a local government team in general, who might have limited resources and knowledge about GIS but still find ways in which GIS can be useful to the team. For that reason, I am also looking forward to learning more about GIS software other than Esri.
